### 3.1. The "Echo" - Character Customization
The player's avatar is their **Echo**, a fully customizable digital form.
*   **Modular Body:** Players can swap out individual parts (head, torso, arms, legs) with various cybernetic models. Materials range from matte synthetics to polished chrome and translucent casings that reveal glowing internal circuitry.

*   **Public Hubs:** Social spaces like neon-lit lounges, rooftop gardens, and underground data-havens designed for meeting and interacting with other Echos.
